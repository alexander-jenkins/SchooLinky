# Status Update!
SchooLinky is currently being rebased to javascript and will be hosted as a webapp. There currently is no timelime for updates or releases as I am working on this in my free time as a university student.

# What is SchooLinky?
SchooLinky is an online portal which holds the URLs, times, and names of each one of a student’s classes, then arranges them in a way which is easy to access, and provides a link in the center of the page for the next class on a student’s schedule. This saves the student time by allowing them to go straight to their class, rather than having to click through several different pages to find what they are looking for to access assignments and join video lectures.
